            <li>1 cup Button Mushrooms fresh, finely sliced (equivalent 4-5 medium mushrooms)</li>
            <li>3 teaspoons Butter</li>
            <li>1 Small Garlic Cloves peeled and crushed</li>

            <li>1 pinch Chilli Flakes or ground pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instruction Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Crack and beat the eggs in a small bowl. Season with salt, pepper and set aside in the fridge while cooking the vegetables.</li>
            <li>Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat, warm butter. When hot, add mushrooms slices, crushed garlic a pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Stir fry for about 1-2 minutes, until the mushrooms are roasted and fragrant. Stir in spinach and keep cooking until wilted. Take off the skillet and set it aside on a plate. Cover with a piece of foil to keep warm.</li>
            <li>Add olive oil, warm, and spread it evenly into the pan, tilting the pan in a rotating motion.</li>
            <li>Reduce to medium-low heat, add beaten eggs and tilt the pan again to spread the egg mixture all over the pan.</li>
            <li>When the sides of the omelette are set and start to dry out, lift them with a spatula to let the uncooked eggs from the middle run under and cook.</li>
            <li>Once the middle of the omelette starts to set, sprinkle the shredded mozzarella on one half of the omelette and top with cooked spinach and mushrooms.</li>
            <li>Fold the omelette in half, reduce to low heat and keep cooking until cheese is melted.</li>
            <li>Gently slide on a plate and adjust seasoning, adding more salt, pepper, fresh parsley, or a pinch of chili flakes to taste.</li>
        </ol>

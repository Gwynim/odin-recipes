        <p class="description text">It's freezing cold outside, and has been for days. All I want to eat is cozy comfort food like this vegan chili recipe. It's my favorite, and leftovers taste even better the next day.</p>

        <p class="description text">This chili is perfect for watching football games with a crowd, since it's a hearty meatless option that carnivores will enjoy.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>2 tablespoons</strong> extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li><strong>1 medium</strong> red onion, chopped</li>
            <li><strong>1 large</strong> red bell pepper, chopped</li>
            <li><strong>2 medium</strong> carrots, chopped</li>
            <li><strong>2 ribs</strong> celery, chopped</li>
            <li><strong>½ teaspoon</strong> salt, divided</li>
            <li><strong>4 cloves</strong> garlic, pressed or minced</li>
            <li><strong>2 tablespoons</strong> chili powder</li>
            <li><strong>2 teaspoons</strong> ground cumin</li>
            <li><strong>1 ½ teaspoons</strong> smoked paprika</li>
            <li><strong>1 teaspoon</strong> dried oregano</li>
            <li><strong>1 large can (28 ounces)</strong> or 2 small cans (15 ounces each) diced tomatoes**, with their juices</li>
            <li><strong>2 cans (15 ounces each)</strong> black beans, rinsed and drained</li>
            <li><strong>1 can (15 ounces)</strong> pinto beans, rinsed and drained</li>
            <li><strong>2 cups</strong> vegetable broth or water</li>
            <li><strong>1</strong> bay leaf</li>
            <li><strong>2 tablespoons</strong> chopped fresh cilantro, plus more for garnishing</li>
            <li><strong>1 to 2 teaspoons</strong> sherry vinegar or red wine vinegar or lime juice, to taste</li>
            <li><strong>Garnishes</strong>: chopped cilantro, sliced avocado, tortilla chips, sour cream or crème fraîche, grated cheddar cheese, etc.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instruction Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat, warm the olive oil until shimmering. Add the chopped onion, bell pepper, carrot, celery and <strong>¼ teaspoon</strong> of the salt. Stir to combine and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender and the onion is translucent, about <em>7 to 10 minutes</em>.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic, chili powder, cumin, smoked paprika and oregano. Cook until fragrant while stirring constantly, about <em>1 minute</em>.</li>
            <li>Add the diced tomatoes and their juices, the drained black beans and pinto beans, vegetable broth and bay leaf. Stir to combine and let the mixture come to a simmer. Continue cooking, stirring occasionally and reducing heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer, for <em>30 minutes</em>.</li>
            <li>Remove the chili from the heat and discard the bay leaf. For the best texture and flavor, transfer <strong>1 ½ cups</strong> of the chili to a blender, making sure to get some of the liquid portion. Securely fasten the lid and blend until smooth (watch out for hot steam), then pour the blended mixture back into the pot. (Or, you can blend the chili briefly with an immersion blender, or mash the chili with a potato masher until it reaches a thicker, more chili-like consistency.)</li>
            <li>Add the chopped cilantro, stir to combine, and then mix in the vinegar, to taste. Add salt to taste, too—I added <strong>¼ teaspoon</strong> more at this point. Divide the mixture into individual bowls and serve with garnishes of your choice. This chili will keep well in the refrigerator for about 4 days or you can freeze it for longer-term storage.</li>
        </ol>

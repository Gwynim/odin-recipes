        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>It's freezing cold outside, and has been for days. All I want to eat is cozy comfort food like this vegan chili recipe. It's my favorite, and leftovers taste even better the next day.</p>

        <p>This chili is perfect for watching football games with a crowd, since it's a hearty meatless option that carnivores will enjoy.</p>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This tasty easy creamy thick black bean curry is dairy-free, vegan, full of Indian-style flavors, and ready in under half an hour. Mildly spiced with a few tricks that make it taste just like a restaurant-style curry.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tablespoons plant-based spread</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
            <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>4 large garlic cloves, crushed</li>
            <li>5 medium tomatoes (350 grams), seeded and finely chopped</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)</li>
            <li>½ tablespoon ground coriander</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon garam masala</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon turmeric</li>
            <li>3.5 cups cooked black beans (580g, roughly two cans)</li>
            <li>2 - 2.5 cups vegetable stock (depending on how much sauce you want)</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons coconut cream</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons fresh cilantro leaves to serve, finely chopped (optional)</li>
            <li>1.5 teaspoons kasuri methi (optional but recommended)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instruction Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt spread in pan on medium-high heat. Add cumin seeds.</li>
            <li>When cumin seeds brown and crackle (after about two minutes), add the onion. Cook around five minutes until onions are lightly browned.</li>
            <li>Add garlic and cook one minute.</li>
            <li>Add tomatoes, reduce heat to medium and fry around five to six minutes, stirring often, until tomatoes are soft and disintegrating.</li>
            <li>Add the cayenne, cilantro, garam masala and turmeric. Mix well and fry one minute more.</li>
            <li>Add the drained rinsed beans and vegetable stock. Add salt to taste (I added ¼ tsp but it will depend on how salty your vegetable stock is). Increase heat to high until simmering lively and then reduce to medium to a simmer for twelve minutes until thickened to your liking depending on how much sauce you like in your curries.</li>
            <li>Add the coconut cream, half the cilantro leaves, and the kasuri methi, rubbing the kasuri methi between your fingers to crumble it in. Mix well and sprinkle remaining cilantro leaves on top to serve.</li>
        </ol>
